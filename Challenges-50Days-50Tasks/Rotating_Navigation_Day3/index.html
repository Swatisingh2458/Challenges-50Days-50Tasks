        <h4>Significance and Rituals</h4>
        <p>
          The Maha Kumbh Mela holds profound spiritual importance in Hinduism.
          Pilgrims gather at the Triveni Sangam—the confluence of the Ganges,
          Yamuna, and the mythical Saraswati rivers—to perform ritualistic
          baths. These sacred dips are believed to purify the soul and aid in
          attaining Moksha, or liberation.
        </p>
        <h4>Technological Advancements</h4>
        <p>
          Branded as the 'Digital Maha Kumbh' by the Indian government, the 2025
          festival integrates advanced technologies to enhance safety and
          convenience. Authorities have deployed facial recognition systems and
          AI-based software to manage crowds, prevent stampedes, and assist in
          reuniting separated individuals. Over 2,700 CCTV cameras and
          underwater drones provide real-time monitoring, while multilingual
          chatbots on the Kumbh app offer support to visitors.
        </p>

          A temporary city spanning 4,000 hectares has been established to
          accommodate attendees. This setup includes 150,000 tents, 3,000
          kitchens, 145,000 restrooms, and 99 parking lots. To manage the influx
          of pilgrims, Indian Railways has introduced 98 special trains making
          3,300 trips during the festival.

          sustainability, such as installing temporary sewage treatment plants
          to maintain river cleanliness and promoting eco-friendly practices

          medical facilities have been set up, including a 100-bed temporary
          central hospital and the deployment of over 400 doctors and 700
          paramedical staff. Specialized care for women, children, and the
